# Python - Serialization

## Introduction
This project explores marshaling and serialization, focusing on transforming data for storage and transmission between systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand differences between marshaling and serialization
- Implement serialization in practical programming tasks
- Apply serialized data in web applications and network communications
- Evaluate performance of different serialization formats (JSON, XML, binary)

## Tasks

### 0. Basic Serialization
Create a module with functions to:
- Serialize Python dictionary to JSON file
- Deserialize JSON file back to Python dictionary

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes
Implement:
- Custom class with name, age, and is_student attributes
- Methods for serializing/deserializing using pickle module
- Display method for object attributes

### 2. CSV to JSON Converter
Create function to:
- Read CSV data
- Convert to JSON format
- Write to data.json file
- Handle exceptions appropriately

### 3. XML Serialization
Develop functions for:
- Serializing dictionary to XML format
- Deserializing XML back to Python dictionary
- Proper type handling and conversion
